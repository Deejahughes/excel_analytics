For this project, I carried out a full end to end analysis of Café Harmony’s sales, customer behaviour, inventory, and staff performance using Microsoft Excel. The process followed a structured analytical workflow which highlights my analytical process, technical capability, and ability to turn raw data into strategic insights.

## Data Analysis

- I completed the Café Harmony sales and marketing analysis using a structured Excel workflow. 
- The process began with data cleaning, where I standardised formats, removed errors, and prepared consistent tables for analysis. 
- I then linked datasets using lookup functions and structured references to create a reliable analytical model.
- Using pivot tables and charts, I conducted an exploratory analysis to identify trends in sales, customer behaviour, menu performance, inventory levels, and staff productivity.
- From these patterns, I generated clear, actionable insights.
- Finally, I designed an interactive Excel dashboard featuring key KPIs, slicers, and dynamic visuals, allowing users to explore performance by month, location, product, and customer segment.
- This end to end process transformed raw data into a strategic, decision ready view of the café’s operations.
